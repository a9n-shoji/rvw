# Architecture

rvw is a human reading environment for the software produced by a pull request. Its primary code
read model is the repository snapshot at an exact Git commit. Pull Request metadata explains intent;
commit ranges and diffs are derived lenses that locate change inside that snapshot. Changed files do
not limit which repository documents can be opened, searched, or commented on.

rvw is a local Node.js application with four boundaries:

- `domain`: pure commit/document, shared code-reference, comment, Walkthrough, and line-mapping rules.
- `application`: use cases shared by HTTP and CLI transports.
- `infrastructure`: SQLite, Git, GitHub CLI, filesystem, and subprocess adapters.
- `server`, `cli`, and `web`: transport and presentation only.

The SQLite database is user-global. Observed PR heads are retained by `refs/rvw/...` in the base
repository's common Git directory. The browser polls `app_meta.change_sequence`; there is no
persistent daemon or agent session coupling. While a viewer process is running, it exposes a
user/database-specific Unix socket inside a `0700` temporary directory as an alternate transport for
the same application service. Agent
CLI operations prefer that socket and fall back to direct local execution only before a request has
been sent and only when no socket path was explicitly configured. `RVW_AGENT_SOCKET_PATH` is
fail-closed: an unavailable or database-mismatched configured socket never falls back to SQLite. A
sent operation with an unknown outcome is never automatically repeated. Concurrent viewers for one
database acquire an atomic filesystem owner lock before listening, so one socket name is held by one
Node process; a follower takes over only after that owner exits. Transport diagnostics report the
socket, connection, database identity, selected transport, and fallback reason. Doctor also executes
a rollback-only write transaction instead of inferring writeability from Unix modes.

The viewer reads committed Git objects rather than the worktree or index. That keeps the human's
reading context stable while an external Agent edits, tests, commits, and pushes. Comments bridge the
two processes through stable references and the JSON CLI protocol: an authorized Agent can create an
ordinary unresolved thread or act on an existing one through the same application validation used by
the browser. Post bodies remain UTF-8 Markdown source in SQLite and render as sanitized GFM with soft
line breaks, repository-relative links and images, and strict display-only Mermaid diagrams. Link and
image resolution uses the post's related commit, repository target, current Walkthrough source, or
thread creation head in that order. A post may additionally own validated `rvw-ref:` links backed by
typed paths and optional line ranges at its exact related commit. Comment Markdown still has neither
source-position targets nor Mermaid-node bindings. Walkthroughs reuse the same code-reference model
and renderer while adding their document mapping and diagram bindings. Browser state, prompts, and
Agent sessions never enter the domain model.

New root posts and replies also append a database-wide event sequence. A long-running external Agent
task may consume that sequence with an opaque database-scoped cursor through `rvw comment watch`.
rvw retains minimal event identifiers independently of deletable posts and owns only ordering and
replay. The bundled Skill's task-local state script atomically owns its cursor, queue, leases, retries,
per-thread status post, self-event suppression, and repository-writer serialization. After claim, the
task creates or restores one immediate acknowledgement and later edits that same normal post to the
final outcome. Separate tasks may consume the same log
with separate state. This terminal-bound consumer is not a daemon and rvw never starts it. A durable
reply-idempotency ledger makes an exact caller-payload retry safe without introducing Agent session
identity into comments.

Walkthroughs cross the same one-way CLI boundary in the other direction. An Agent can publish a
Markdown explanation fixed to one commit, with validated file references and optional inclusive line
ranges, plus optional Mermaid-node bindings. SQLite stores one current explanation per stable Walkthrough
ID without revision history. The CLI can read and replace that value in place; the HTTP API remains read-only except for a
human-confirmed delete action. Whole-document comments keep targeting the stable ID across updates. Rendered
Markdown text selection maps parser source positions to inclusive source-line comments; those comments retain a
document hash and exact quote, re-anchor only on a unique current match, and otherwise appear Outdated. Mermaid
feedback targets the complete source fence rather than generated SVG nodes. Deletion removes the Walkthrough and
its attached feedback together. Publication and update do not
include viewer state and cannot navigate a browser. The React viewer treats a
Walkthrough as another document tab, and only a human action opens the referenced exact Git document.
Inline references and bound Mermaid nodes remain interactive, but the viewer does not duplicate the
complete reference set in a side or bottom index.
The browser owns an ephemeral two-pane workspace: every document identity belongs to one pane, tabs can
move between panes, and modifier-click targets the right pane from the sidebar or the opposite pane from
within a document. Pane placement never enters SQLite or the Agent protocol. Repository Markdown uses
the same exact Git document fetch and can switch locally between source and a safe rendered preview.
The preview preserves native browser text selection while translating parser positions back to source line ranges;
it never persists DOM or layout coordinates.
The selection boundary resolves to the smallest mapped Markdown leaf, and its composer is portaled
into a React-owned declarative slot in normal document flow immediately after the selected block so
wrapped text is never covered.
Relative preview and comment images are fetched from their resolved exact commit through a size-limited
read-only endpoint. PR Markdown, Walkthrough bodies, external image URLs, and paths that cannot be resolved inside the repository
render as non-fetching placeholders. Same-origin SVG asset responses carry a restrictive Content Security
Policy and sandbox so direct navigation cannot execute repository-controlled script under the viewer origin.

The bundled Skills are named by capability rather than Agent host. `rvw` handles review comments and
synchronization; `rvw-walkthrough` converts the current session's explanation into a validated,
commit-fixed publication without prescribing its document structure; `rvw-watch-comments` keeps an
external Agent task subscribed to newly created posts and fails closed on PR ownership. Codex and Claude Code receive
the same Skill directories under their respective local Skill roots. Platform selection is a packaging
concern only and does not fork the Agent protocol or workflow instructions. Installer metadata records
the bundled digest so update availability and local customization are reported separately.

Each automatically opened browser document attaches an ephemeral viewer ID to that poll. The
per-viewer worker uses those IDs only to stop its HTTP listener after the final tab closes; they are
never persisted and are not part of review state or the agent CLI protocol. By default, the parent
`rvw open` process starts that worker in the background, opens the browser after the worker reports
readiness, waits for the first viewer heartbeat, and then returns control to the terminal. This is a
browser-owned worker rather than a persistent daemon. `--foreground` and `--no-open` remain
terminal-signal managed.
